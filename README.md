# Banknote Recognition in Automated Vending Machines using MobileNetV2 CNN achitecture
##email me for the dataset


## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a **Botswana Pula** banknote recognition system for use in automated vending machines. The goal is to develop a robust and efficient solution that accurately identifies and classifies banknotes, enabling seamless transactions in vending machines.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Google colab


*HOW TO SET UP FOLDERS AND WHERE EACH FILE IS SAVED* :

click the link to my google drive to get access dataset and editional files.
link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rBQnYqCGsrc5mc-cKFvRXZ7ljrN1lSEn?usp=sharing

 the folder to be used is "Banknote_Rec", 
 it has all datasets i.e 'BANKNOTES2" and 'split_datasets2',
 as well as the saved models i.e., "classifier1.h5", "classifier2.h5", "classifier3.h5", "classifier4.h5"
 adjust the file paths as needed to accomdate the new file locations 

*HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS* :

This project requires a computer with a dedicated GPU (most recommended) for faster training of the deep neural network but can also be ran on the collab CPU.

*ORDER IN WHICH TO RUN CODE* :

the code can be run from top to bottom in its respective order - for any code that has been commented out , however if it is necessary to check all aspects of the code feel free to uncomment the sections and run them. 

*Expected Run Time*

- Each cell in the Notebook is expected to run within a reasonable time frame i.e. for smaller cells not more than 2mins, for splitting and augmentation between 5mins to 10mins and for training the models between 3hrs to 4hrs


## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a reliable banknote recognition system for automated vending machines, ensuring accurate and efficient transactions. The implemented deep learning model demonstrates robustness in classifying various denominations.
